    <h2>Past Projects</h2>
    <p>One of the first open-ended projects we had done this year was creating a group tourism website with around two to three other students. We used other, real tourism websites to base our own website off of, and learned. We used Visual Studio to code the entire website, which had included a contact page, destinations pages, and travel info pages for every location.

        The instructions for this project also required our code to pass a validator, which meant that on top of creating the website, the code we had used to create it had to be fully functional without any flaws, even if they didn’t affect the code at a surface level.
        
        The end product of our website had actually turned out to be much nicer than any of us had expected. While it still had a few primitive qualities, it ran relatively smoothly for being our first or second real website-design project. It was during this project where I had realized the importance of the CART Habits of Mind, more specifically, collaboration and communication. Without the usage of these two skills, the project would’ve been next to impossible for us to complete, as we were all doing different parts of the project at once, and had to communicate to understand what we had finished, and what else we had been working on
