        <h2>Past Projects</h2>
        <p>One of the first open-ended projects we had done this year was creating a group tourism website with around two to three other students. We used other, real tourism websites to base our own website off of, and learned. We used Visual Studio to code the entire website, which had included a contact page, destinations pages, and travel info pages for every location.</p>
    
          <p>  The instructions for this project also required our code to pass a validator, which meant that on top of creating the website, the code we had used to create it had to be fully functional without any flaws, even if they didn’t affect the code at a surface level. </p>
            
            <p>The end product of our website had actually turned out to be much nicer than any of us had expected. While it still had a few primitive qualities, it ran relatively smoothly for being our first or second real website-design project. It was during this project where I had realized the importance of the CART Habits of Mind, more specifically, collaboration and communication. Without the usage of these two skills, the project would’ve been next to impossible for us to complete, as we were all doing different parts of the project at once, and had to communicate to understand what we had finished, and what else we had been working on

            <p> Early on in the school year, we utilized a website by the name of Figma to create a prototype or wireframe for our website. We would use Figma for most major projects in order to get an idea for what we had wanted our website to look like without needing to apply any actual code to it.</p>
    
               <p> By using Figma, we learned how to design nice looking, yet realistically possible websites for our project. Although our end design would usually end up looking much different than the Figma wireframe, it gave us an idea of the direction we wanted our website to go in.</p>
                
                <p>The most common challenge we would face when using Figma was understanding the many features that it contained, and utilizing it properly. Figma had taught us how to use the CART habit of mind “Persist”, as we had to persist through learning Figma in order to use it properly throughout the rest of the year.
