        <p> Nixon was born into a poor family of Quakers in a small town in Southern California. He graduated from Duke Law School in 1937, practiced law in California, then moved with his wife Pat to Washington in 1942 to work for the federal government. After active duty in the Naval Reserve during World War II, he was elected to the House of Representatives in 1946. His work on the Alger Hiss Case established his reputation as a leading anti-Communist, which elevated him to national prominence, and in 1950, he was elected to the Senate. Nixon was the running mate of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Republican Party's presidential nominee in the 1952 election, and served for eight years as the vice president.

            <p>Papers Stolen from Republican-Democrat headquarters in Washington DC confirming the President Of The United States has asked his staff and fellow government agencies to assist him in spying on his political opponents and possibly incriminating/damning evidence against the Nixon presidency linking it to possible war crimes and obstruction of justice in the United States. A speech by the president will be made soon regarding this matter.</p>

            <p>So many choice-centered games have such awful major-choices.
            </p>
            <p>I feel like a good morally testing question in games that are supposed to have your choices reflect who you are as a person should actually have their major choices not be so binary. A good morally challenging question shouldn’t have an option that the player can say is ‘definitely correct’ or is an outright ‘good vs bad’ type choice. Those types of choices don’t test anything. They might change the story, sure, but a majority of the players that are keeping true to their own opinion and mindsets instead of going out of their way to think differently are always going to pick the ‘good’ option.
            </p>
            <p>Telltale’s The Walking Dead provides a good example of choices that don’t actually have a right or wrong answer. In Season 1 Episode 2, the game makes it clear that two characters, Lilly and Kenny, are constantly at each other's throats, and it’s almost the players responsibility to either try and side with one of them, or stay neutral. If the player tries to stay neutral, the game repeatedly warns the player that they can’t stay neutral forever. Later, after the group is stuffed in the meat locked by the Saint John’s, the game finally forces the player to make a choice. Assist Kenny in murdering Lilly’s father after he passes out due to a heart attack to avoid risking being trapped in a room with a walker, or help Lilly attempt to save her father by preforming CPR. </p>
 <p>The choice doesn’t end up changing anything; at least, it doesn’t on the surface. Lilly’s father will die no matter what choice the player makes, but the choices change how other characters interact with your character, Lee, later on in the story. If you end up siding with Lilly too much, Kenny will refuse to help you near the end of the game after Clementine, Lee’s not-so-officially but basically adopted daughter, goes missing. On the contrary, siding with mostly Kenny will cause Lilly to act more aggressively towards Lee, and change how she thinks of him when she returns in Season 4. Although players might be dissatisfied with their ‘lack of meaningful choice’, this is a good example of a realistic scenario in which there truly is no correct answer. One choice will leave one side grateful and the other spiteful, and another choice will leave the opposite effect. Good meaningful choices shouldn’t typically have options where every party is pleased, it just doesn’t create a believable scenario. </p>
 <p>I believe choices like Larry in the meat locker are much more realistic and immersive than, for example, making the choice to unreasonably kill certain factions in a Fallout or Elder Scrolls game. Now, of course, those are role playing games. You are meant to be playing a character who would behave that way, that’s why those choices exist, but a majority of people playing these games for the first time don’t really make a character. They either just mess around and choose the silliest or most evil option, or go off of their own judgment, which is almost always the set ‘good’ choice, or whatever choice progresses the story (since most characters will be morally good, but also an assassin, thief, cult leader, and everything else under the sun).</p>
   
    <p> Some games will not have a definitive good or bad answer, but will have one of those answers lead to a ‘bad’ or ‘good’ ending. I feel as if this is also very uninspiring and doesn’t provoke thought at all. Many players will simply look up ‘gamename best ending route’ and go for whichever route gives them the best outcome. Besides, a fully good and fully bad ending aren’t typically too realistic either. Some endings will be ‘better’ or ‘worse’ than others, some will be by definition bad, but all of the surviving characters will be happy, and consider their ending good. If you don’t set a defined ‘good’ ending, it causes that chunk of players that try and search for how to unlock the good ending to think: What is the good ending in their eyes? I find this to be much more effective at provoking thought in the player then, for example, ‘actions x y and z and decisions a b and c lead to the definitive best ending’
